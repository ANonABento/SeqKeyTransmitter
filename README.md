ECE 198 - Code for the STM32 microcontroller on the wrist-mounted housing

In charge of:
1. Decoding GPIO-based key inputs into letters and actions
2. Transmitting that data to the STM32 receiver through UART lines

Repository for the code on the STM32 receiver: https://github.com/ANonABento/SeqKeyReceiver
