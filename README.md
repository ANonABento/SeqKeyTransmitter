# SeqKey Transmitter Code
ECE 198 - Code for the STM32 microcontroller on the wrist-mounted housing

In charge of:
1. Decoding GPIO-based key inputs into letters and actions
2. Autocompleting user's word with a trie and fuzzy search through Google's top 10,000 most common words list
3. Transmitting that data to the STM32 receiver through UART lines

Repository for the code on the STM32 receiver: https://github.com/ANonABento/SeqKeyReceiver
